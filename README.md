### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Philippe Ndiaye.

I am a software developer currently based in Lyon, France. I am a big Ember.js enthousiast willing to contribute to the framework. Most of my work is within [@upfluence](https://github.com/upfluence)'s codebase where I focus in product engineering as well as developer experience.

You can follow me on [X / Twitter](https://twitter.com/phndiaye) where I mostly post about Ember and frontend technologies.
